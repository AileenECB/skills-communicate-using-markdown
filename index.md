###### Here's some java just for fun.
``` java
boolean hasPiano = true;
```
###### Now here is what you need to learn how to read sheet music:
- [ ] A Piano
- [ ] A Slice of Paper
- [ ] A Pencil

###### Some prerequisite information includes
###### * Where middle C is 
###### * the order of notes is: A, B, C, D, E, F, G

##### First: Draw the staff.
###### The treble clef is on the top and the bass clef is on the bottom, like this:

###### Make sure there are five horizontal lines in each clef. 

##### Next: Learn the lines and spaces. 
###### In the treble clef, the lines represent the following notes (from bottom to top): E, G, B, D, F. A good acronym to remember this is Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge.

###### In the bass clef, the spaces represent the following notes (from bottom to top): A, C, E, G. A good acronym is All Cows Eat Grass.

##### Lastly, ledger lines
###### If a note is too high or too low to fit in the clef, ledger lines are used to extend the staff just for that note so you can read it. Sometimes, there can be five or more which can be tricky to count, making it slow to determine the note while sightreading. I would suggest making flashcards and memorizing notes associated with ledger lines in each clef.
